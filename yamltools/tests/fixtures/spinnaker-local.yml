# This file is intended to override the default configuration in the
# spinnaker.yml file while providing guidance on the mostly likely
# configuration parameters to be changed.
#
# In order for Spinnaker to discover it, it must be copied to a file named
# "spinnaker-local.yml" and placed in /opt/spinnaker/config
# (or when running from source code, in the $HOME/.spinnaker directory.)
#
# A better practice could be to create the spinnaker-local.yml file by
# hand with only the particular attributes that you want to override
# and use the spinnaker.yml file as your guide since it is spinnaker.yml
# that we are overriding here in the first place.

providers:
  # See http://www.spinnaker.io/v1.0/docs/target-deployment-setup
  # for general information about configuring spinnaker platform providers.

  # Each of the following providers can be enabled independent of all other
  # providers unless otherwise noted.
  #
  # Each provider can be enabled by setting its 'enabled' attribute to true.
  # As a rule of thumb, each provider defines a 'primaryCredentials' block
  # that configures a default account for Spinnaker to use on that platform.
  # If additional accounts are desired, then add those accounts to a
  # custom clouddriver-local.yml file and consult clouddriver.yml for more
  # information on what to add there.
